# sift

Currently trying to implement SIFT from Scratch in Python, 
Some Issues I've Encountered till now:
1. For a lot of keypoints, the histogram has no value while calculating orientations
2. The resulting Image is obviously not what one would want
3. Still run into a lot of issues with data types and image normalization
