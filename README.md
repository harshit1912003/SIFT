# SIFT: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform Implementation

## Overview

This project aims to implement the **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** algorithm from scratch using Python. SIFT is a foundational algorithm in computer vision, used extensively for feature detection and description in images. By recreating SIFT manually, this project provides deeper insights into the mechanics of the algorithm, including keypoint detection, descriptor generation, and scale invariance.

### Why SIFT?

SIFT is crucial for tasks like:

- Object recognition
- Image stitching
- 3D reconstruction
- Motion tracking

## How SIFT Works
SIFT operates through the following steps:
### 1. Scale-space Construction
A series of images is created by progressively blurring the input image with a Gaussian kernel. These images form a pyramid-like structure, allowing keypoints to be detected across different scales.

### 2. Keypoint Localization
Potential keypoints are identified as local maxima or minima in the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) images. These points are refined by eliminating low-contrast points and those located along edges, ensuring stability and reliability.

### 3. Orientation Assignment
For each keypoint, a dominant orientation is calculated based on the gradient directions of the surrounding pixels. This step ensures rotation invariance.

### 4. Descriptor Generation
Each keypoint is described by a vector representing the gradient orientations and magnitudes in its local neighborhood. This descriptor is robust to changes in illumination and viewpoint.

The project provides an implementation and explanation of each step in detail, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of SIFT.

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Keypoint Orientation:** Some keypoints result in empty histograms during orientation calculations.
2. **Visualization Errors:** The resultant images often deviate from expected outputs.
3. **Data Type Conflicts:** Handling inconsistencies with data types and normalization processes.
